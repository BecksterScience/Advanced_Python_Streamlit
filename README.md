# Analyzing Most Efficient Ways to Sort/Group/Filter Using Advanced Python Techniques

## üìå Description

This project aims to identify and implement the most efficient methods for performing sorting, grouping, and filtering operations in Python. Our approach is structured around six key tasks, each focusing on a different aspect of data processing optimization.

Each task will independently analyze and optimize a specific operation, and the results will be combined to develop a highly efficient, modular data processing tool. The project will leverage profiling tools (line_profiler, cProfile, memory_profiler) to compare various techniques and select the best-performing methods.

At the end of this project, we will integrate all findings into a Streamlit dashboard, allowing users to visually explore and compare different optimization strategies in real-time.This project aims to identify and implement the most efficient methods for performing sorting, grouping, and filtering operations in Python.
